We are excited to have you join our team and work on the Project \"Work To-Dos.\" Please read through this document carefully to get familiarized with the project, workflows, and tools used in the development process.\n\nProject Overview\n\nWork To-Dos is a web application that allows users to add work tasks to a to-do list, mark them complete, and remove them from the list. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.\n\nDevelopment Workflow\n\nOur development workflow follows the Gitflow branching strategy. You will be working on the \"develop\" branch, which contains the most recent changes and features. When you start a new task, create a new branch off \"develop\" with a descriptive name (e.g., \"feature-add-item-form\") and work on that branch until the task is complete.\n\nBefore you push your changes to the remote repository, make sure to pull the latest changes from \"develop\" to avoid conflicts. Once you have completed your task, create a pull request to merge your changes into \"develop.\" Your pull request will be reviewed by another developer on the team before it is merged.\n\nEnvironment Setup\n\nTo get started, make sure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:\n\n- Git\n- Node.js\n- Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor\n\nOnce you have installed these tools, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open the project in Visual Studio Code and run the following command in the terminal to install the project dependencies:\n\nnpm install\n\nTo start the development server, run the following command:\n\nnpm start\n\nThis will launch the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.\n\nCoding Standards\n\nWe follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for our coding standards. Make sure to run the following command before you push your changes to ensure your code adheres to the style guide:\n\nnpm run lint\n\nIf there are any errors, fix them before submitting your pull request.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope this onboarding document has provided you with a good understanding of the project, workflows, and tools used in the development process. If you have any questions or need any further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to your team leader. Welcome aboard, and happy coding!"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}]}
