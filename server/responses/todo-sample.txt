As a front-end developer, you will be working on the Work To-Dos project. Please carefully read through the following information to get started.\n\nProject Overview\n\nWork To-Dos is a simple to-do list application that allows users to create a list of tasks. The user can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Your role as a front-end developer will be to work on the presentation layer, creating an engaging and responsive user interface.\n\nTechnologies\n\nTo work on this project, you need to have a good understanding of the following front-end technologies:\n\n- HTML\n- CSS\n- JavaScript\n\nYou should also be familiar with the following:\n\n- Git and Version Control\n- Command line interface\n- Code editors such as Visual Studio Code\n\nProject Setup\n\nTo get started with the project:\n\n1. Clone the project repository from GitHub. `$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/worktodos.git`\n2. After cloning, navigate to the project folder. `$ cd worktodos`\n3. Install the project dependencies. `$ npm install`\n4. Start a development server. `$ npm start`\n5. Open your web browser and go to `localhost:3000`.\n\nProject Structure\n\nThe project contains the following files and directories:\n\n- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the project.\n- **styles.css**: The main CSS file for the project.\n- **script.js**: The main JavaScript file for the project.\n- **node_modules**: The directory containing all project dependencies.\n- **package.json**: The file that describes the project and its dependencies.\n- **README.md**: The file containing project information and instructions.\n\nCode Structure\n\nThe code is organized into functions and files that perform specific tasks. The code structure follows best practices for maintainability and reusability:\n\n- `inputLength()`: This function returns the length of the user's input.\n- `listLength()`: This function returns the number of items in the list.\n- `createListElement()`: This function creates a new list item and adds it to the list.\n- `crossOut()`: This is a function that adds a line-through style to completed items.\n- `deleteListItem()`: This function adds a delete button to each list item, and when clicked, removes the item from the list.\n- `addListAfterClick()`: This function is triggered when the user clicks the \"enter\" button, and it adds a new list item to the list.\n- `addListAfterKeypress(event)`: This function is triggered when the user presses the enter key, and it adds a new list item to the list.\n\nCoding Style\n\nTo maintain consistency across the codebase, we follow strict coding style guidelines. Please review the following style guidelines before you begin working on the project:\n\n- HTML: We use `fourspaces` to indent HTML code.\n- CSS: We use `fourspaces` to indent CSS code and we use `kebab-case` for class names.\n- JavaScript: We use `two spaces` to indent JavaScript code. We use `camelCase` for variable and function names.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope this onboarding document has provided you with the necessary information to get started on the project. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask your team leader or the project manager. Thank you for joining our team, and we look forward to working with you!"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}]}
